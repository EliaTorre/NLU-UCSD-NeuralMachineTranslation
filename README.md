>**<p align="justify"> Abstract:** *This paper presents the research undertaken in exploring three major leaps in the context of Neural Machine Translation. In order to do so, three milestone articles in the field of Neural Machine Translation are posed under analysis, i.e., "Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks" <a href="NLU Papers/Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks.pdf">[1]</a>, "Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate" [2] and "Attention Is All You Need" [3]. The architectures described in the articles are implemented from scratch in the notebook associated with this repository and their performances are evaluated according to BLEU score on the German to English translation task based on "Multi30K" dataset.*
